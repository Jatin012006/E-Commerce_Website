                <p>
                Hi, I'm <strong>Puneet Jha</strong>, the founder and CEO of <em>PNET</em>. 
                My journey began with a simple vision: to create a platform that combines innovation, 
                creativity, and real value for people. Technology has always fascinated me, and 
                I wanted to build something that makes life easier, smarter, and more connected.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                With a background in Computer Engineering and a passion for solving problems, 
                I started this company to deliver solutions that truly make a difference. 
                Over the years, I’ve learned that success is not just about business growth, 
                but about building trust and delivering excellence consistently.
                </p><br>

                At <em>PNET</em>, our mission is simple: to empower users with tools 
                and experiences that are intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable. Every feature 
                we develop, every update we roll out, is centered around one core belief—putting 
                our users first.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                When I’m not working on new ideas, I love exploring technology trends, playing chess, 
                and diving deep into space-related topics. I believe continuous learning is the key 
                to staying ahead in this fast-paced world.
                </p><br>
